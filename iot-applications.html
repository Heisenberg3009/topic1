    <h1>Developing IoT Applications</h1>
    <p><h2><em>Activity 1 of Topic 1 was three major fundamental questions:</em></h2> 
      1. What is an IOT  apllication?<br>
      2. What are the main features nedded?<br> 
      3. What are some examples?<br>
      <h3><u>1. What is an IOT application?</u></h3>
      It is an application that interconnects devices so that they can communicate with each other eithout using any human interference.<br>
      <h3><u>2. What are the main features nedded?</u></h3>
      1. Software and Platform<br>
      2. Sensors and Devices<br>
      3. Communication with the user and other devices connected with.<br>
      <h3><u>3. What are some examples?</u></h3>
      Some of the examples but not limited to are: <br>
      1. Smart Buildings<br> 
      2. Traffic Monitoring Systems<br>
      3. Security Systems<br>
      4. Healthcare <br> 
      5. Inventory Management
    </p>

    <p><h2><em>Activity 2 of Topic 1 took interest in a speacial case study: Smart Buildings.</em></h2>
      It dealt with the questions:<br>
      1. What does Smart mean?<br> 
      2. What are the main features of a Smart Building?<br>
      3. What are Smart Building scenarios? 
      <h3><u>1. What does Smart mean?</u></h3>
      Smart has technically many meanings in computer science, but fundamentally it comes to: The ability collect data from lots of sources and grouping them in a 
      single location and then running algorithms to make changes in the real world.<br>
      <h3><u>2.  What are the main features of a Smart Building?</u></h3>
      Some features include but not limited to:<br> 
      1. Regulation<br>
      2. Sensor Tehnology<br> 
      3. Cloud Computing<br> 
      4. Centralized Event Processing<br> 
      <h3><u>3. What are Smart Building scenarios?</u></h3>
      1. Temperature Control<br>
      2. Automated Lighting<br>
      3. Lighting Management<br> 
      4. Security System<br>
      5. Hazard Detection<br>
      6. Monitoring Energy Usage<br>
      7. Light and Heat Sensors 
    </p>

    <p><h2><em>Activity 3 of Topic 1 dealt with a further extension of Actity 2:</em></h2>
      1. What are some high level features nedded?<br>
      2. What are the parts needed?<br>
      3. Who are the the users?<br> 
      <h3><u>1. What are some high level features nedded?</u></h3>
      1. Data Visualization<br>
      2. Multiple IoT devices with varying capability<br>
      3. Processing power<br> 
      4. Connectivity<br>
      5. Data Management<br>
      6. I/O Ports<br>
      7. Memory<br>
      8. Sensors<br>
      9. Actuators<br>
      <h3><u>2. What are the parts needed?</u></h3>
      1. Data<br>
      2. Sensors<br>
      3. Code and scripts<br>
      4. Server<br>
      <h3><u>3. Who are the users?</u></h3>
      1. People living/working in a building<br> 
      2. Device Manufacturers<br>
      3. System Administrators<br> 
      4. Management<br>
      5. Large companies<br>
      6. Commercial Usage<br> 
    </p>

    <p><h2><em>Some famous IoT aplications right now are:</em></h2>
      1. Smart home<br>
      2. Wearables<br>
      3. Smart City<br>
      4. Smart grids<br>
      5. Industrial internet<br>
      6. Connected car<br>
      7. Connected Health<br>
      8. Smart retail<br>
